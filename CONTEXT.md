# banshu-ai

A Rust library for streaming chat with open-source LLM providers over the
OpenAI-completions and Anthropic-messages wire protocols.

## Language

### Model discovery

**Catalog**:
The bundled, offline model baseline for a provider — JSON generated from
models.dev at build time and compiled into the crate.
_Avoid_: model list, static models

**Catalog Refresh**:
A runtime fetch of models.dev that overrides same-id Catalog entries and adds
new ones, with full metadata.
_Avoid_: dynamic catalog, remote catalog

**Probe**:
A best-effort call to a provider's own list-models endpoint. Yields bare model
ids only; it can add models the Catalog doesn't know, never remove or change
them.
_Avoid_: model listing, discovery call

**Overlay**:
The in-process merged result of Catalog ← Catalog Refresh ← Probe that a
provider serves as its model list. Never persisted; lost when the process
exits.

**Zero-means-unknown**:
The metadata convention for Probe-synthesized models: cost, context window,
and max tokens are `0` to mean "unknown", never guessed.

### Core (established)

**Provider**:
A configured vendor endpoint: id, base URL, env-var auth, wire protocol, and
compat quirks. Mostly data; per-vendor constructors set defaults.

**Registry** (`Models`):
The runtime collection of Providers offering lookup, auth-gated availability,
and stream dispatch by model id.

**In-band error**:
A failure delivered as a stream event carrying partial content, not a
`Result::Err`. Only setup/config errors are `Result`s.
